## Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px">
- 🔭 I’m currently working on nothing
- 🌱 I’m currently fucked up ✌️
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on nothing
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with anyone
- 💬 Ask me about nothing
- 😄 Pronouns: for practical purposes: I don't exist.
- ⚡ Not a fun fact: 
   * I am learning how to code with anyone
   * Ah that doesn't matter
   * my IDE: Termux
   * Neovim is my favorite code editor ❤️
